description: Autonomous single-shot plan execution. Runs entire superplan implementation plans without stopping, using sub-agents for each phase. Phases write state to filesystem for resume capability. Sequential phases run in order, parallel phases (1a, 1b) run concurrently. User never needs to compact context.
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: skulto
compatibility: Requires plan document in superplan format. Sub-agents execute phases independently. State persisted to .autobuild/ directory.

# Autobuild: Autonomous Plan Execution Engine

Execute entire implementation plans in a single pass with zero user intervention. Each phase runs in its own sub-agent, writing state to the filesystem. Context never exhausts because sub-agents are isolated.

## Overview

Autobuild is an **autonomous execution engine** for superplan implementation plans. Unlike `superbuild` which stops after each phase for user confirmation, autobuild runs everything to completion.

**Key Differences from superbuild:**

| Aspect | superbuild | autobuild |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Execution | Phase-by-phase with stops | Continuous until complete |
| User intervention | Required after each phase | None (fully autonomous) |
| Context management | Manual compaction | Sub-agents isolate context |
| State persistence | In conversation | Filesystem (.autobuild/) |
| Resume capability | Manual | Automatic from state files |

## Critical Workflow

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      AUTOBUILD EXECUTION FLOW                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|  1. INITIALIZE       |  Parse args, create .autobuild/, detect stack  |
|         |            |  NO PLAN = EXIT (ask user, then exit if none)  |
|         v            |  NO --commit = STOP (require commit mode)      |
|  2. LOAD STATE       |  Read existing state files if --resume         |
|         |            |  Identify completed phases, pending phases     |
|         v                                                             |
|  2.5 PLAN REVIEW     |  Validate plan before autonomous execution     |
|         |            |  Check: ambiguity, deps, tests, risks, conflicts|
|         v            |  IF concerns → EXIT (autonomous = no recovery) |
|  3. EXECUTE PHASES   |  For each pending phase (or parallel group):   |
|     |                |                                                |
|     |  3a. Launch sub-agent(s) for phase(s)                           |
|     |      - Sequential phases: one sub-agent at a time               |
|     |      - Parallel phases (2a,2b,2c): concurrent sub-agents        |
|     |                                                                 |
|     |  3b. Sub-agent executes:                                        |
|     |      - Read plan section for its phase                          |
|     |      - Follow TDD micro-structure per task                      |
|     |      - Run quality gates (lint, test, typecheck)                |
|     |      - Update plan checkboxes                                   |
|     |      - Return: status, commit message, files changed            |
|     |                                                                 |
|     |  3c. Write state file for phase                                 |
|         |                                                             |
|         v                                                             |
|  4. VERIFY + COMMIT  |  Re-run quality gates fresh (trust but verify) |
|         |            |  Handle git based on --commit mode              |
|         v                                                             |
|  5. ON FAILURE       |  Retry once, then halt with state preserved    |
|         |            |  Parallel siblings may continue before halt    |
|         v                                                             |
|  6. COMPLETION       |  All phases done, output summary               |
|                      |  State files preserved for audit               |
|                                                                       |
|  =====================================================================|
|  Sub-agents are ISOLATED. Context never exhausts. State is on disk.   |
|  =====================================================================|
|                                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize

**REQUIRED: Plan document and commit mode must be provided.**

### Argument Validation

```
AUTOBUILD INITIALIZATION
=========================

Plan: [path]
Commit Mode: [auto|message-only|single]

Validating...
```

**If no plan provided:**
```
ERROR: No plan document provided.

Usage: /autobuild <plan-path> --commit=<mode>

Example: /autobuild docs/feature-plan.md --commit=auto

[EXIT - Cannot proceed without plan]
```

**If no --commit mode specified:**
```
COMMIT MODE REQUIRED
====================

Before I can execute this plan, I need to know how to handle git commits.

Please specify one of:
  --commit=auto         Auto-commit after each successful phase
  --commit=message-only Generate messages, you handle git (recommended)
  --commit=single       One combined commit after all phases complete

Example: /autobuild docs/feature-plan.md --commit=message-only

[WAITING FOR COMMIT MODE]
```

**NO EXCEPTIONS.** Do not proceed without explicit commit mode.

### Directory Setup

Create `.autobuild/` directory structure:

```
.autobuild/
  config.json           # Execution configuration
  phases/
    phase-0.json        # State file per phase
    phase-1.json
    phase-2a.json
    phase-2b.json
    ...
  logs/
    execution.log       # Overall execution log
    phase-0.log         # Per-phase logs (truncated sub-agent output)
    ...
```

> **STOP. Read [STATE-FILES.md](references/STATE-FILES.md) NOW** for complete state file format.

### Stack Detection

Detect technology stack to determine quality commands:

```
STACK DETECTION
===============

Detected:
- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: Express
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Test Framework: Jest
- Linter: ESLint
- Formatter: Prettier

Quality Commands:
- Lint: pnpm run lint
- Format: pnpm run format:check
- Typecheck: pnpm run typecheck
- Test: pnpm test

Stack saved to .autobuild/config.json
```

---

## Step 2: Load State (Resume Support)

If `.autobuild/` exists and `--resume` (or default):

```
LOADING EXISTING STATE
======================

Found existing execution state:
- Config: .autobuild/config.json
- Phase files: 6 found

Phase Status:
| Phase | Name | State File | Status |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| 0 | Bootstrap | phase-0.json | complete |
| 1 | Setup | phase-1.json | complete |
| 2A | Backend | phase-2a.json | failed |
| 2B | Frontend | phase-2b.json | complete |
| 2C | Tests | phase-2c.json | pending |
| 3 | Integration | phase-3.json | pending |

Resuming from Phase 2A (first incomplete)...
```

If `--fresh` specified:
```
FRESH START
===========

--fresh flag detected. Clearing existing state.

Removed: .autobuild/ (6 state files)
Created: .autobuild/ (fresh)

Starting from Phase 0...
```

---

## Step 2.5: Critical Plan Review

**Before executing, validate the plan for autonomous execution.**

Unlike interactive superbuild where users can catch issues between phases, autobuild runs autonomously. Plan validation is therefore MORE critical.

### Review Checklist

1. **Ambiguous tasks** - Any task unclear about what to do?
2. **Missing dependencies** - Are required files/APIs/packages identified?
3. **Test gaps** - Does each task have testable acceptance criteria?
4. **Risky changes** - Any destructive operations or breaking changes?
5. **Parallel conflicts** - Could parallel phases modify the same files?

### If Concerns Exist

```
⚠️  PLAN REVIEW - Concerns Identified
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. [Concern 1 - what and why]
2. [Concern 2 - what and why]

Autonomous execution requires clear plans.
Please clarify before I proceed.

[EXECUTION BLOCKED - Plan validation failed]
```

**For autonomous builds, DO NOT proceed with ambiguous plans.** Exit and request clarification.

### If No Concerns

```
PLAN VALIDATION: PASSED
=======================

- Tasks: Clear and actionable
- Dependencies: Identified
- Tests: Acceptance criteria present
- Risks: None detected
- Parallel safety: No file conflicts expected

Proceeding to execution...
```

---

## Step 3: Execute Phases

### Phase Ordering

> **STOP. Read [PHASE-EXECUTION.md](references/PHASE-EXECUTION.md) NOW** for phase ordering rules.

Parse plan to build execution order:

1. **Identify all phases** from plan overview table
2. **Build dependency graph** from "Depends On" column
3. **Identify parallel groups** from "Parallel With" column
4. **Topologically sort** for execution order

```
EXECUTION ORDER
===============

Batch 1 (sequential): Phase 0
Batch 2 (sequential): Phase 1
Batch 3 (parallel): Phase 2A, 2B, 2C
Batch 4 (sequential): Phase 3

Total: 6 phases in 4 batches
```

### Launching Sub-Agents

> **STOP. Read [SUBAGENT-PROMPTS.md](references/SUBAGENT-PROMPTS.md) NOW** for exact sub-agent prompts.

#### Sequential Phase

```
EXECUTING PHASE 1: Setup
========================

Launching sub-agent...

[Sub-agent executes autonomously]
[Reads plan section]
[Follows TDD micro-structure]
[Runs quality gates]
[Updates plan checkboxes]
[Returns result]

Sub-agent complete. Processing result...
```

#### Parallel Phases

```
EXECUTING PARALLEL BATCH: 2A, 2B, 2C
=====================================

Launching 3 sub-agents in parallel...

[Sub-agent 2A: Backend API]
[Sub-agent 2B: Frontend UI]
[Sub-agent 2C: Edge Case Tests]

Waiting for all sub-agents to complete...

Results received:
- Phase 2A: complete
- Phase 2B: complete
- Phase 2C: complete

Processing parallel results...
```

**CRITICAL:** Use Task tool with `run_in_background: true` for parallel phases, then collect results with TaskOutput.

### Sub-Agent Execution

Each sub-agent:

1. **Reads the plan** - Specific section for its phase
2. **Follows TDD** - 5-step micro-structure per task
3. **Runs quality gates** - Lint, test, typecheck
4. **Updates plan file** - Checks off completed tasks
5. **Returns structured result** - JSON with status, commit, files

Sub-agent does NOT:
- Run git commands (unless --commit=auto in main agent)
- Modify other phases
- Access conversation history from main agent

---

## Step 4: Verify and Commit

### Fresh Verification (Trust But Verify)

> **STOP. Read [VERIFICATION.md](references/VERIFICATION.md) NOW** for verification requirements.

**After sub-agent reports success, VERIFY FRESH in main agent:**

```
VERIFICATION - Phase 2A
=======================

Sub-agent reported: complete

Running fresh verification...

Lint:      pnpm run lint           ... PASS
Format:    pnpm run format:check   ... PASS
Typecheck: pnpm run typecheck      ... PASS
Tests:     pnpm test               ... PASS (47 tests)

All quality gates passed.
```

**If verification fails (sub-agent claimed success but check fails):**

```
VERIFICATION MISMATCH
=====================

Sub-agent claimed success, but fresh verification failed:

Tests: FAIL
  5 tests failed in src/services/auth.test.ts

This indicates a sub-agent error. Treating as phase failure.
Initiating retry...
```

### Commit Handling

Based on `--commit` mode:

#### --commit=auto
```
AUTO-COMMIT - Phase 2A
======================

git add src/api/auth.ts src/api/auth.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(auth): implement JWT token validation

- Add validateToken function
- Add token refresh endpoint
- Add comprehensive test coverage
EOF
)"

Commit created: a1b2c3d
```

#### --commit=message-only
```
COMMIT MESSAGE - Phase 2A
=========================

feat(auth): implement JWT token validation

- Add validateToken function
- Add token refresh endpoint
- Add comprehensive test coverage

Files to commit:
- src/api/auth.ts (CREATE)
- src/api/auth.test.ts (CREATE)

[Message saved to .autobuild/phases/phase-2a.json]
[User handles git operations]
```

#### --commit=single
```
PHASE 2A COMPLETE
=================

Commit message queued for final combined commit.
Continuing to next phase...
```

### State File Update

After each phase (success or failure), update state file:

```
STATE UPDATED - Phase 2A
========================

File: .autobuild/phases/phase-2a.json
Status: complete
Commit: feat(auth): implement JWT token validation
Files: 2 created, 0 modified
Timestamp: 2025-01-25T10:30:00Z
```

---

## Step 5: Handle Failures

> **STOP. Read [FAILURE-HANDLING.md](references/FAILURE-HANDLING.md) NOW** for failure handling.

### Retry Logic

On phase failure, retry ONCE:

```
PHASE FAILURE - Phase 2A (Attempt 1/2)
======================================

Sub-agent reported failure:
- Tests failed: 3 failing in auth.test.ts
- Linter: passed
- Typecheck: passed

Initiating retry...

RETRY - Phase 2A (Attempt 2/2)
==============================

Launching fresh sub-agent with error context...

[Sub-agent executes with knowledge of previous failure]
```

### Parallel Sibling Handling

If a parallel phase fails, let siblings complete:

```
PARALLEL BATCH FAILURE
======================

Phase 2A: FAILED (after retry)
Phase 2B: complete
Phase 2C: running...

Waiting for 2C to complete before halting...

Phase 2C: complete

EXECUTION HALTED
================

Phase 2A failed after retry.
Siblings 2B and 2C completed successfully.

State preserved in .autobuild/
Resume with: /autobuild docs/feature-plan.md --commit=auto --resume
```

### Halt State

```
AUTOBUILD HALTED
================

Execution stopped due to: Phase 2A failure (tests failing)

Completed phases:
- Phase 0: Bootstrap (complete)
- Phase 1: Setup (complete)
- Phase 2B: Frontend (complete)
- Phase 2C: Tests (complete)

Failed phase:
- Phase 2A: Backend (failed after retry)

Remaining phases:
- Phase 3: Integration (blocked by 2A)

State preserved: .autobuild/

To resume after fixing:
  /autobuild docs/feature-plan.md --commit=auto --resume

To start fresh:
  /autobuild docs/feature-plan.md --commit=auto --fresh
```

---

## Step 6: Completion

When all phases complete:

```
+=====================================================================+
|                     AUTOBUILD COMPLETE                               |
+=====================================================================+

## Rationalizations to Reject

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Let me run multiple phases in one sub-agent" | **NO.** Each phase gets its own sub-agent for context isolation |
| "I'll skip the state file for this phase" | **NO.** State files enable resume and audit |
| "The sub-agent passed, no need to verify" | **NO.** Fresh verification is mandatory |
| "Let me just continue after failure" | **NO.** Retry once, then halt |
| "Sequential phases can run in parallel" | **NO.** Respect dependency order |
| "I'll batch the verification at the end" | **NO.** Verify after each phase |
| "The plan doesn't specify commit mode" | **NO.** Require --commit before execution |
| "Let me auto-commit without being told" | **NO.** Explicit commit mode required |

---

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP:

- "Context is getting long, let me combine phases"
- "This phase is simple, I can skip the sub-agent"
- "The retry failed, but let me try once more"
- "Sequential phases don't really depend on each other"
- "I'll write the state files at the end"
- "Verification is redundant, sub-agents are reliable"
- "The user probably wants auto-commit"

**All of these = violation of autobuild protocol.**

---

## The Iron Rules

1. **Explicit commit mode** - Never start without --commit flag
2. **One sub-agent per phase** - Context isolation is non-negotiable
3. **State file per phase** - Written immediately after completion/failure
4. **Fresh verification** - Never trust sub-agent claims alone
5. **Single retry on failure** - Then halt with state preserved
6. **Respect dependencies** - Sequential means sequential
7. **Parallel means parallel** - Launch concurrent sub-agents
8. **Resume from state** - Check .autobuild/ before starting
9. **Preserve state on halt** - Enable future resume
10. **No user intervention** - Fully autonomous execution

**Autobuild is rigid by design.** The sub-agent isolation prevents context exhaustion. The state files enable resume. The verification ensures quality. Do not rationalize around it.
