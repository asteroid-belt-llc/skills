## Minimal Report

For quick sessions, use this abbreviated format:

```markdown
# Supercharge Report - [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Summary**: Fixed [N] issues ([X] critical, [Y] high)

## Fixed
- [issue] in [file] (refactoring: [name])
- [issue] in [file] (refactoring: [name])

## Remaining
- [N] issues deferred to next session

## Next Priority
1. [file/area]

**Tests**: PASS | **Linter**: PASS
```

---

## Report Automation

The report should capture:

1. **Quantitative data** - Issue counts, fix counts
2. **Qualitative data** - What patterns are most common
3. **Actionable insights** - What to focus on next
4. **Verification** - Proof that tests still pass

Do NOT include:
- Full code listings (use file:line references)
- Implementation details of fixes
- Personal opinions about code quality
- Blame/attribution for issues
